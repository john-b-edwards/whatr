> _This_ R package was made to facilitate the analysis of game show data by
scraping the [J! Archive][ja].

> What is... whatr?

## Installation

The release version of 'whatr' can be installed from [CRAN][cran]:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("whatr")
```

You can install the development version of 'whatr' from [GitHub][gh] with:

```{r github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/whatr")
```

## Usage

The `whatr_*()` functions take one of four inputs to find the appropriate
game on the J! Archive:

1. An HTML document object from `whatr_html()` or similar.
2. The numeric, non-sequential game ID.
3. The sequential show number, as character starting with `#`.
4. The date an episode originally aired, as `yyyy-mm-dd`.

```{r usage}
library(whatr)
page <- whatr_html("2019-06-03")
whatr_board(page)[, 5:7]
whatr_scores(6304)
whatr_plot("#8006")
```

## Data

Included in this package is data on the 217 episodes of the show's 35th season.

```{r data}
whatr::episodes
whatr::synopses
```
